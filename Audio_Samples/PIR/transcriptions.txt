Rat came and replied on the leaves.
Paul's teeth ached because of lemon.
Poor tom now is dead.
To catch that bulrush root with my paw.
Now quicker the fiddle went.
Am I an absolute pauper?
Rat came and replied on the leaves.
But we are not high yet.
I must have two to fetch and carry.
A deafening chirruping rent the air.
How rash you are.
It's to say how do you do with tom's answer.
Do you think it's a woozle?
The nastiest things they saw were the cobwebs.
A deafening chirruping rent the air.
A raging fire was in his eyes.
